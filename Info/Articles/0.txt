Keep This File In Here
January 1st, 2000
This file needs to be here so the server does not crash due to the article boards. You can have up to 10 articles at a time, so have each file similar to the contents of this one. Each file must be named 1 to 10 (1.txt, 2.txt, etc.), and contain only 3 lines. The first line is the title. The second line is the date. The last line is the message. Messages will appear on the board from 10 to 1.
